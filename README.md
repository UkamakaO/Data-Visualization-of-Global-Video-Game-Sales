# Data-Visualization-Project
### Introduction
A tableau dashboard is created as an infographic tool to tell two stories for two research questions asked by a marketing manager of a games-producing company. The dashboard view is redesigned in Power BI for comparison of how I achieved the dashboard to answer the research questions using both methods (Tableau and Power BI). 

### Data
The Global Video Game Sales dataset was retrieved from the Kaggle website in 2022 . It was originally published by Gregory Smith on the Zenodo website  in 2022 who sourced the data from vgchartz.com. The dataset captures the top 100 video games worldwide along with their respective platforms, genres, publishers, and sales regionally and globally. Primarily, there are 11 columns and 16,600 rows in the dataset. However, additional columns are computed from the already existing variables to facilitate our storytelling. The data dictionary below shows the key original variables along with the new variables shown in bold:

### Persona and Questions
The user is a marketing manager for a sports game-producing company. He wants to create targeted advertising campaigns for upcoming games they are producing. He has asked the following questions:
1.	In which year did the most popular sports games publisher record his highest growth in global sales and which platform influenced its growth in sales the most?
2.	Between 2011-2016, was there a strong correlation in sales of sports games between any pair of regions and which was the top-selling sports game common to the regions?
